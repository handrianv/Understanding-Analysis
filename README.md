The book: [Understanding Analysis, 2nd Edition by Stephen Abbott](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4939-2712-8). Also check out its [MAA review](https://old.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/understanding-analysis). This repo contains my solutions to the exercises.

I don't even remember why I started doing this, but at this point I'm already hooked. I can't stop. Who knew Real Analysis is such a *fun* and *beautiful* subject?

If you stumbled upon this page, two things I want to say:
- Thank you for visiting my Github!
- Do not use this as a solution manual.  Not because solution manuals are bad, but because this note would make for a poor one . <br/>
 I wrote this in the style of a personal note. Every solution is much more verbose than it needs to be, because I want to record my thought process. At least for *learning* math, I'm not a big believer in presenting a clean, polished proof that seems to appear magically out of thin air, making every problem look trivial, whereas behind the scene the process
 of finding that polished proof is full of wrong twists and turns. On that note, I also recorded all my *incorrect* attempts, and there are *lots* of them :)

But if you still wish to use it anyway, then feel free to do so, and I'll greatly appreciate any suggestions or improvements. This is my first time tackling a pure math book. Happy solving!
